# Zoe Setup
> Be aware that to set up Zoe you need the `Manage channels` permission on your server (if you are not the administrator anyway).
{.is-warning}

<br>

## Adding Zoe 
You can add Zoe to your server by clicking on [<kbd>Add to Discord</kbd>/<kbd>Invite Zoe</kbd>](https://zoe-discord-bot.ch) on the homepage, on sites like [top.gg](https://top.gg/de/bot/550737379460382752) or [bots.ondiscord.xyz](https://bots.ondiscord.xyz/bots/550737379460382752) and here on the Wiki in the bottom left in the menu bar.
<br>
  
## Authorizing Zoe
Now you may have to log in to Discord, then select the server you want to add Zoe to and confirm Zoe's permissions. You may have to solve a captcha and then you can start.

## Setup
When Zoe is added for the first time, it sends a short message to the default channel of the server.

Then follows the first setting. You should select the language you want Zoe to speak on your server. (For more information, see [`/language`](/en/commands/administrative/language)). You can navigate with the reactions and then confirm the language you want Zoe to speak.

Directly after that, you have to select the standard [League of Legends server region](/en/terms/region) (which you can find here if you need help: [Regions](/en/terms/region)).

> Don't worry, you can always choose any region you want. Setting the default region will not lock any other regions.
>{.is-warning}

> You can change this setting later in the configuration if you wish (see [`/config`](/en/commands/administrative/config)).

Now Zoe sends another message about what you can do next. Read more in the next section.

**You can now _follow this page_ (recommended) if you are not sure what you want and want to get an overview or continue with the [guide for a server with friends or for a team](/en/Guides/Team-Server) or the [guide for a  community server](/en/Guides/Community-Server) to see differentiated lists.**
  
<br>

# 1\. Adding data (aka registering [players](/en/terms/player))
To use Zoe, you must first [register](/en/commands/player/register)/[create](/en/commands/player/create) [players](/en/terms/player). A [player](/en/terms/player) consists of a Discord account and one or more League of Legends accounts and will be displayed in the various [features](/en/features) you will use.

**There are two ways of doing so:**
1.  You can create them with the commands [`/create player`](/en/commands/player/create) (allows you to create a discord account with a League account for everyone/someone else)
2.  Also, you can enable the option in the [configuration](/en/Zoe-Configuration) that any Discord user on your server can use the [`/register`](/en/commands/player/register) command to connect their own account (See more under [`/register`](/en/commands/player/register) and [`/config`](/en/commands/administrative/config)).
- [`/add account`](/en/commands/player/addaccount) allows you to add a League of Legends account to an already registered/created [player](/en/terms/player).
- To delete a [player](/en/terms/player), use the commands [`/delete player`](/en/commands/player/delete) (delete the player) and [`/remove account`](/en/commands/player/removeaccount) (delete a player's League account).

> You can display all registered [players](/en/terms/player) with the [`/show players`](/en/commands/player/show-players) command if you wish.
>{.is-info}

<br>

# 2\. Show players (aka use [features](/en/features))
>You don't have to set up any of these [features](/en/features), this is just a suggestion-list. If you want to look around all features, [here is a link to all the features](/en/features) and [here to all commands](/en/commands/).

## Automated Discord roles by League rank
You can set up an automatic rank system with Zoe easily. The roles will be refreshed regularly automatically. The premium version of this feature offers more options (filter by server region, display of each division, full control over each role and more).

![](/img/features/rankroles.jpg)

- [Rankroles *For more information about rankroles click here.*](/en/features/rankroles)
{.links-list}
  
<br>
  
Once your features are set up correctly, they will update automatically as soon as a game is detected via the Discord presence of [registered players](/en/terms/player) or once an hour at least. You can also refresh your server with the command [`/refresh`](/en/commands/basic/refresh).
 
<br>
  
# 3\. Customize these features (because every server is different)
To manage Zoe and all the different settings it offers, use this command: [`/config`](/en/commands/administrative/config). 
 Read everything about the configuration here: [**Configuration**](/en/Zoe-Configuration/).

<br>
  
# 4\. Going further (We never stop!)
Zoe has many more features. You can have a look at all commands if you click [HERE](/en/commands).
One example being [`/stats profile`](/en/commands/stats/profile) letting you view a players profile:
