# What is “Déjà Queue”?
## Information
**“Déjà Queue” is a quick lookup that shows which players in your current match you (or the selected [player](/en/terms/player)) have recently queued with, teammates and opponents alike.**  
**You access it directly via the button under each [gamecard](/en/features/gamecards) in the [infochannel](/en/features/infochannel).**  
<br>

#### Why the name?
**It’s a play on words:** *déjà vu* (“I’ve seen this before”) + *queue* (league match queue).  
The feature helps you recognize familiar names at a glance, perfect for those *“that username looks familiar…”* moments on the loading screen.
<br> 

#### Limitations
**“Recently”** refers to the **recent games Zoe has indexed**, availability depends on your tracked history. The maximum is 3 months (set by the Riot API) or 1000 games (set by us) in the past, whichever occurs first.
