# Betting
## Information
**In the rankchannel, you can wager Bet Points on the outcome of ranked games played by [players](/en/terms/player). At game start, Zoe posts a betting prompt with win probabilities for both teams, based on AI-powered predictions (click [here]() if you want to learn more). Compete with others to climb the betting leaderboard — and don't worry if you lose everything, you’ll earn points automatically just by playing League. [Subscribers](/en/support) get bonus points through multipliers based on their tier.**
