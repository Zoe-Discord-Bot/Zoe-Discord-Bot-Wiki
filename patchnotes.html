          <h2>Refresh System Per Account Rework &amp; QOL&nbsp;</h2>
          <h3>V1.13.15 → V1.14.0</h3>
          <p>Hello everyone! I'm thrilled to announce a major update focused on <strong>reliability, accuracy and responsiveness</strong> of Zoe. These issues have been a pain point for a long time, and it's long overdue for something to be done. Zoe should be way quicker to send messages related to the start of games, rank changes and end of games, especially after the first game of a session. <strong>Large servers now have a new "Player Activity Hub" Infopanel</strong>, to avoid the unreadable wall of text which sometimes was close to 300 messages in some huge servers.</p>
          <p>Some QOL and bugfixes have also been added, the add command can now be used on Discord user which are not already registered on Zoe and some Clash bug fix have been made.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Changelist:</p>
          <p><strong>Reworked Refresh System</strong></p>
          <p>Accounts are now refreshed independently every 20 minutes (with premium servers enjoying faster refresh rates of 10 minutes or 5 minutes based on their size). Zoe intelligently detects games and adjusts the refresh schedule <i>per account </i>accordingly:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>One refresh between 7-8 minutes into the game.</li>
            <li>Every 2 minutes after 15 minutes into an ongoing game.</li>
            <li>Every 2 minutes after a game finishes for 5 minutes. (for a duration of 20 minutes, assuming that a player is likely to replay a game after completing one.)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Additionally, the infopanel and leaderboard will now refresh only when changes occur, which coupled with a lot of internal optimization drastically reduce the Discord API requests by a factor of 5!</p>
          <p>This should greatly improve refresh latency and accuracy.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>NEW FEATURE</strong> A new type of infopanel has been created for huge servers (more than 120 leagues accounts) called "Player Activity Hub", showing the players currently in a game and the last 10 rank changes (with the team on the left). If a huge amount of smaller servers asks for this type of infopanel for smaller servers, this will be added as an option in the future.</li>
            <li><strong>QOL</strong> The <code>/add account</code> command can now be used with users without any registered accounts!</li>
            <li><strong>QOL </strong>The infopanel has been decluttered to be more readable (no need to say that Diamond 4 is a rank :p)</li>
            <li><strong>Bug Fix</strong> Fixed performance issues related to master rank in EUW slowing down the whole app (more than 10.000 poeple are master in EUW which caused a lot of issues)</li>
            <li><strong>Bug Fix</strong> Clash Channel issues related to a change in the API, Clash channel should now work as inteeded (if Riot's servers are not exploding).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <h2>Team Filter in Leaderboards</h2>
          <h3>V1.13.14 → V1.13.15</h3>
          <p>Hello everyone! <strong>Today I'm rolling out a new version of Zoe that lets you create leaderboards filtered by team.</strong> You can access this features through the "Edit Leaderboard" button below each leaderboard. <strong>This new feature is only available for premium servers.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Here's a small hint relative to a futur features that will come really soon : <i>Always wanted to bet against your friends?</i>&nbsp;</p>

          <h2>Lower Refresh Rate for Premium Servers</h2>
          <h3>V1.13.13 → V1.13.14</h3>
          <p>Hello everyone! I'm adding a small new patch <strong>that increase the refresh rate of medium and small premium servers (boosted servers) to 10 minutes for server with less than 125 league accounts and 5 minutes for server smaller than 50 league accounts.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The goal is in the long term to rework the refresh system in a "per player" system that would increase global performance and Zoes accuracy. In the meantime, we can allow better refresh rate to users which support the project.&nbsp;</p>

          <h2>SoloQ Teammate Finder Update&nbsp;</h2>
          <h3><strong>V1.13.9 → V1.13.10</strong></h3>
          <p>Hello everyone! I'm very excited to announce a new experimental feature: the "SoloQ Teammate Finder". This feature adds a button to the info channel (there's also a command) that will allow you to search for a SoloQ teammate of your rank and play with your new partner in Voice Chat! Zoe will set up a private voice room for you on a neutral server.</p>
          <p>This feature is experimental and we are really curious what you think of it! That's why we'll be sending out a feedback form in the near future.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>If we see that there is a lot of interest in the feature, we will develop new functionalities for it!</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>How to access the feature:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>New infochannel button</li>
            <li>New command <code>/social soloq-teammate-finder</code></li>
          </ul>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The feature will be available on 15/06/2024, 18:00 UTC+2</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Changelist:</p>
          <p><strong>NEW FEATURE</strong> Now you can automatically search for a SoloQ partner with Zoe! Our system allows you to find someone with your Elo to play with by voice, so you can coordinate and play with an advantage over your opponents! This feature is experimental and we will develop it further if we see interest from our users!</p>

          <h3><strong>V1.13.6 → V1.13.7</strong></h3>
          <p>Hello everyone! Today we're releasing a patch that brings a number of significant improvements to Zoe's team system. Many things have been reworked and redesigned. I hope you enjoy it! It's been a long time since this feature was developed and a little facelift can only do it good.</p>
          <p>Changelist:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>NEW OPTION</strong> With the new "Team Self Adding" option, you can allow all players registered on your server to add themselves to the team of their choice. This new option enables the <code>/join</code> and <code>/leave</code> commands and simplifies this operation for users. <strong>This option is available for all servers and can be enabled with the command </strong><code><strong>/config</strong></code> <i>-&gt; User Management -&gt; Option 4️⃣.</i></li>
            <li><strong>QOL </strong>Zoe now uses Discord's new autocomplete system to suggest teams when you use the various commands that prompt you to select a team.</li>
            <li><strong>QOL </strong>The <code>/add playertoteam</code> and <code>/remove playerfromteam</code> commands have been improved to allow multiple players to be added to or removed from a team at the same time.</li>
            <li><i>Internal Change</i> Migration to the new Spectator API, should not change anything but if you notice any issue, please report it.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3><strong>V1.13.4a → V1.13.5</strong></h3>
          <p>I finally have a little more time for Zoe for a few weeks! I have a few things planned for the next few weeks. I can't wait to get to work! This is the first patch to my plans. My first goal is to make Zoe more accurate in these posts in general, especially on the Rank channels side. I will start with this patch to completely rework the way Zoe refreshes the information it collects to be more accurate. This first patch is a step in that direction. Here is the patch note:</p>
          <p>Changelist:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>QOL </strong>Match History Channel The match history channel feature is now more reliable. A message is always sent to the channel as soon as a running game is detected, even if it is impossible to retrieve it via the API! This means that custom games are now also displayed in the game history! (with limited information, but still).</li>
            <li><strong>Experimental QOL</strong> Rank Channel Zoe now shows games with 0 LP changes. The next patch will mainly focus on the accuracy of this message. This is something i want to improve!</li>
            <li><strong>Experimental Optimisation</strong> Better utilization of the entire Riot server for some API calls.</li>
            <li><i>Dev Tools </i>Addition of internal tools to better record the usage of some features (buttons and selections).</li>
          </ul>
          <p><i>As always, if you have any bugs, comments or requests, you can report them in the appropriate channels.</i></p>

          <h3><strong>V1.13.3a → V1.13.4</strong></h3>
          <p>A minor update today to allow for the transition to the new nickname system. All commands have been updated to reflect this and display Riot IDs instead of Summonernames.</p>
          <p><strong>Since a lot of code has been changed everywhere in a short amount of time, please report any issues! It's possible I missed some bugs.</strong></p>
          <p>I also took this opportunity to rework the <code>/stats teamanalysis</code> and <code>/stats predictrole</code> commands, which now require multiple players to be added in a row. This should greatly improve usability!</p>
          <p>Change list:</p>
          <p><strong>Migration</strong> Zoe now uses the Riot IDs! You can now create players using the new system. The Riot ID is now used everywhere instead of the summonername.</p>
          <p><i>QOL</i> The commands <code>/stats teamanalysis</code> and <code>/stats predictrole</code>are now much easier to use! Enter the command only once!</p>
          <p><i>Bug Fix</i> Fixed a bug that caused Zoe's refresh to crash when playing a TFT game in a certain game mode.</p>
          <p>-End of change list-</p>

          <h2>Minor update: O<strong>ption to manage the "rank update" messages</strong></h2>
          <h3><strong>V1.13.2b → V1.13.3a</strong></h3>
          <p>Today's small update <strong>adds an option to manage the "rank update" messages that are automatically sent to the rankchannel.</strong> This way you can either disable them completely or only receive certain messages (e.g. you can disable daily messages and only receive messages per week and month). Some servers that don't play many ranked matches will be flooded with empty messages, so this option is mainly for them! Here is the patchnote:</p>
          <p>Change list:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>NEW FEATURES</strong> You can now manage the sending of "Rank Update" messages! Option accessible via <code>/config</code> &gt; Rankchannel &gt; Option 2</li>
            <li><i>Typo corrected</i> Parameter name of the <code>/stats rankupdate</code> command was corrected</li>
          </ul>
          <p>--End of change list--&nbsp;</p>

          <h2>Match History Update &nbsp;(Zoe Update 1.13)</h2>
          <h3>V1.12.5 → V1.13</h3>
          <p>Today is a big day for Zoe! Indeed, today is the day we add features that have been in the works for a long time. It has been a long way and a lot of effort but it has been worth it. I am very proud and happy to unveil this new patch note. <strong>This update adds the long awaited and requested match history channel system, the new </strong><code><strong>/stats matchhistory</strong></code><strong> command, a new rank-role assignment system based on peak elo. These new features will be in early access for 2 weeks for premium users and will then be available to all</strong> (except for the rank-role system which will be a permanent premium feature).&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>- <strong>(League) NEW FEATURE: Match History Channel</strong> | <i>Early access of 2 weeks for premium users. Will be available to everyone on April 2, 2023.</i>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Create a match history channel to display players' games with stats and graphs. You can create several channels per team, players or for the whole server. Examples are given below. Commands: <code>/create matchhistorychannel</code> | <code>/delete matchhistorychannel</code>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>- <strong>(League) NEW FEATURE: Match History Command</strong> | <i>Early access of 2 weeks for premium users. Will be available to everyone on April 2, 2023.</i>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Added the matchhistory command which will allow you to browse the match history of LoL accounts and view match stats. This feature incorporates a new experimental AI based feature that summarizes your game in one line. I'm interested to hear your thoughts on this new feature. Examples are given below. Command: <code>/stats matchhistory</code>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>- <strong>(League) NEW FEATURE : Discord role by League Peak rank</strong> | <i>Permanently Premium Feature</i>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>You can now assign discord roles by their Peak Elo in League of Legends. You have as much customization possible as the other premium role by rank system.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>- <strong>QOL: Infochannel refresh button and Feedback button</strong> The info channel now has two new buttons:&nbsp;</p>
          <p>-&gt; A new refresh button that allows to do a quick refresh of the server.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>-&gt; A new feedback and bug report button that allows you to send private feedback and/or a bug report directly to the Zoe team (mods of the Zoe official support server and KaluNight).&nbsp;</p>
          <p>- <strong>QOL: Stats profile command</strong> The <code>/stats profile</code> command got some new change. The generated graph has been improved (New Dark theme!). Sending the command without parameter will now select the account of the sender by default.</p>
          <p>- <strong>(TFT) EXPERMIENTAL QOL: Deletion of TFT Rank Channel Game Stats</strong> After some thought and feedback on how little value the TFT game stats were bringing to the rank channel, I'm trying to temporarily remove them in an attempt. This means that the Rank Channel will only show the LP change for TFT. I need your feedback on this change. Do you like it? Would you like to have stats but only the most important ones (Placements, ...)? I am curious to hear your opinions.</p>

          <p>Update day for Zoe! Unfortunately it's not the one that will add several major features like match history. But it's coming soon! Todays update allows Zoe to manage the new Discord endpoints (new way to communicate with their servers) which was mandatory since the old way of doing things was soon no longer available.&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>This is a big update that change a lot of things internally in Zoe, and that can potentially create bugs (even if i have already tested the patch a lot ). If you spot any bugs, please report them to us under support on the discord server.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>-INTERNAL MAJOR CHANGE</strong> -&gt; Zoe now uses Discord API v10. The scale of this update is huge and could create new bugs! Please report them if you find any.&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>-Bug Fix</strong> -&gt; Players that have played a game of the new TFT patch will show up again in the infochannel.&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>-Known Issue</strong> -&gt; TFT data will not be able to be displayed for a while as Riot has introduced a bug in their new match related TFT data that makes it impossible for Zoe to refresh some stats. I'm doing my best to resolve the situation.&nbsp;</p>

          <h2><strong>Subscription Update V2, new features and adaptation for slash commands | Version 1.12</strong></h2>
          <h3><strong>V1.11.1 → V1.12</strong></h3>
          <p>Let's start right away with the core piece of this update: <strong>The new Premium subscription.</strong> Before this update, Zoe's premium subscription was mainly cosmetic and not very attractive. As it is important to be able to finance Zoe in the long term, a solution had to be found. So it was decided to create some premium features. I'll say it again because I don't want to scare you. All the features currently available for free will of course remain free. This subscription will have access to some exclusive features, but the development of the free features will of course not stop (and you will see it here).</p>
          <p><strong>To gain access to these new features, a new premium server system has been created.</strong> As a subscriber, you can "boost" a server with "Zoe points" to give it access to premium features. The number of points depends on the particular subscription you have taken out. Here you can see how many points each subscription gives:</p>
          <p>- Platinum (2 €) : 1 Zoe Point</p>
          <p>- Diamond (5 €) : 3 Zoe Points</p>
          <p>- Master (formerly Challenger) (10 €) : 6 Zoe Points</p>
          <p>- Grandmaster (20 €) : 12 Zoe Points</p>
          <p>- Challenger (30 €) : 18 Zoe Points</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The number of points needed to boost a server depends on the number of League of Legends accounts registered on the server. Here is a list of the different sizes:</p>
          <p>- Small server / 1 Zoe Point: 0-30 League accounts</p>
          <p>- Medium Server / 3 Zoe Points: 31-120 League accounts</p>
          <p>- Large Server / 6 Zoe Points: 121-Infinite League accounts</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Every time you boost a server, points are taken away from it. However, you can cancel the boost at any time to get your points back.</p>
          <p>For more information about this point system. Use the commands ``/subscription`` and ``/boost`` in Discord and read this article &lt;https://wiki.zoe-discord-bot.ch/en/Zoe-Points-And-Boosting&gt;</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Now, let's move on to the new features!</p>
          <h4><strong>1. Premium Server | Improved Rank Role Feature (/config -&gt; Additional Features)</strong></h4>
          <p>As you probably know, Zoe already has an automatic role system based on League of Legends rank. This option is good, but too simple. This new option should allow you to configure your roles down to the smallest detail. Whether by queue (Soloq, Flex and TFT), by division or rank, or by server, anything works! This is the most complex option I have had to develop so far, and by a large margin.</p>
          <p>Here are some screenshots of the menus of the option:</p>
          <p><i>The option allows you to make a pre-configuration</i></p>

          <p><i>You can then modify each role in detail</i></p>

          <p><a href="https://zoe-discord-bot.ch/img/ImprovedRankRoleMenu4.png">https://zoe-discord-bot.ch/img/ImprovedRankRoleMenu4.png</a></p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h4><strong>2. Premium Server | Bigger Leaderboard</strong></h4>
          <p>This highly anticipated feature allows you to increase the size of the leaderboards to the maximum size of 100 players displayed. You can change the size of the leaderboards with the new button below the leaderboards or during creation.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h4>3. Early access for Premium Server and Premium User | Infocards Champions Stats</h4>
          <p>This option allows you to get information about a champion. Spell to max or items, you have quick and easy access to this information. You can access this information directly from the info cards by pressing the new button below. <i>There are plans to add rune stats at a later date.</i></p>
          <p><strong>This option will be free on 31 August</strong>!</p>
          <p>Here is an example: <a href="https://zoe-discord-bot.ch/img/InfoCardsChampionStats.png">https://zoe-discord-bot.ch/img/InfoCardsChampionStats.png</a></p>
          <p><i>Will be available only after a few hours the patch note</i></p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h4>4. Free | Disable auto-remove players Option (/config -&gt; User Management)</h4>
          <p>When a player leaves a server, they are automatically deleted. This new option allows you to remove this behaviour if you wish.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h4>5. Premium Server | Filter Infocards by Game type - Option (/config -&gt; Info Channel Settings)</h4>
          <p>This option allows you to filter the type of info cards generated according to the type of game being played. Perfect for large servers that want to filter what is displayed (e.g. Solo/DuoQ only).</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>I have prepared Zoe for the end of the classic commands.</strong> Zoe will no longer be usable with "&gt;" as of August 31th. I recommend you to use slash commands which works with "/". If you have problems with slash commands, you can use this command format after August 31 only: "@Zoe#7767 example command".</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Other small changes include:</strong></p>
          <p>- The addition of the ``/help``, ``/define`` and ``/undefine`` commands to the slash commands. I had forgotten them when I updated the slash commands :')</p>
          <p>- Adjustment of some commands to the new Discord operation from 31 August.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>As always with this type of large update, unexpected errors may occur. I invite you to report them on the server in the #report-issue channel. If you have any comments, suggestions for improvement or other feedback, I invite you to talk about it under #feedback. I am still looking forward to your comments :ZoeJoy:.</p>
          <p><strong>I sincerely hope that you will enjoy this update. I have been working on it for a long time and I hope it will not disappoint you.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>A big thank you to everyone who has supported me financially to date, including aclcdarktronic, SUNBOOP, SebastianNoll, Deamon, sileNtF1, ninjoi as well as all the other people with lower tiers! Thank you all from the bottom of my heart. I also have a thought for my moderators who provide me with valuable help! I really thank you guys!</strong></p>
          <p>And thank you to everyone who uses Zoe! It's a pleasure to see you using the fruits of my labour ! &lt;3</p>

          <p>- <strong>Optimization</strong> Added a cache for the match history.</p>
          <p>- <strong>Rework</strong> Redesign of the match sending system. Zoe should no longer have an overload problem. This is a massive step.</p>
          <p>- <strong>QOL</strong> added a "generated x minutes ago" section to the leaderboards, infochannel and clash channel.</p>
          <p>- <strong>New Beta testing</strong> of new features on some servers.</p>
          <p>- Many<strong> bug fixes</strong></p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>And that's about it! I'm really excited to show you the new features I've been working on for the last 4 months.</p>
          <p>As always, if you have any bugs, feedback or requests, don't hesitate to report them in the appropriate channels.</p>

          <h2>Match-V5 update (Major background update)</h2>
          <h3>V1.11.0.2.1 → V1.11.0.2.2</h3>
          <p>Hello everyone! This update allows Zoe to use the new Riot api for matches (also called Match-V5). In addition to this simple update, the entire Riot server calling system has been updated with the migration to the R4J library. And not least, the entire caching system has been redone with a dedicated MongoDB database. The update caused some problems. The winrates for infocards are temporarily disabled to compensate for the overload.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>-<strong>Update</strong> Zoe can now use the new match api (Match-V5)</p>
          <p>-<strong>Migration</strong> The entire system of calls to Riot servers has been updated.</p>
          <p>-<strong>Rework</strong> The data cache system has been migrated to a dedicated database to avoid performance problems.</p>
          <p>-<strong>Temporary issue</strong> Winrates in infocards have been disabled due to the limited access to Riot's servers (new access limit with this new system). I work on it.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Next patch</strong>: Features asked by users (For more information, please check #dev-status)</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Disclaimer: You may not realise it but the scale of this update is very large. There is a higher probability of new bugs in already existent features than in other updates. Please report them so I can fix them quickly.</p>

          <h2><strong>Zoe Sharding System and Rank data fix</strong>&nbsp;</h2>
          <h3><strong>V1.10.0 → V1.10.1</strong>&nbsp;</h3>
          <p><i><strong>Hidden Feature</strong></i></p>
          <p>Zoe has now multiple shard, this allow her to support more servers. You are more than 10'000 users! Thanks you for this!</p>
          <p><i><strong>Bug Fix</strong></i></p>
          <p>Sometimes Zoe skip some ranked match (happens most of the time when she is overloaded). We update rank of players with ranked match to avoid the spam of Riot servers (if a ranked game is detected -&gt; the rank will change in some time). But because of that sometimes data are old and not updated. Since this is pretty hard to fix this issue quickly (need to rework the way the system work), i make a way to bypass it. Now the&nbsp;&gt;refresh command force the refresh of the ranked cache. This should fix issue with leaderboard old data.</p>
          <p><i>Note: This can possibly remove the sending of rank channel message in some rare edge case.</i></p>
          <p><strong>Next patch:</strong></p>
          <p>Overall improvements and new small features asked by users. (3-6 months) Like always, if you have some bugs, feedback or request don't hesitate to report them in the appropriate channels.</p>

          <h3><strong>V1.8.0 → V1.8.1</strong></h3>
          <p>I have totally rework the caching system of Zoe. She will now only track event (activity) of registered player. She was tracking every event of near 200'000 discord users before this update. With the need of improve Zoe performance, this is a huge step. Oh and if this was not clear I remind you that we do not store anything about you except for your server configuration of course. When I say "track," understand it as "react" (you start a game of league -&gt; Zoe react). This update is more likely to be problematic than others. If you encounter issues after this update, please report it there ⁠report-issue. I will monitor the situation closely. Thanks you for your comprehension !&nbsp;</p>
          <p>-Each command is now executed in a separete process (avoid freeze of command because of another one). <i>Was already deployed between 1.8.0 and 1.8.1</i>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Zoe now cache users in a smart way. Users who are not registered are no longer cached and tracked.</p>
          <p><code>&gt;about</code> command now show cached users.</p>

          <h2>Database update</h2>
          <h3><strong>V1.4.0 → V1.5.0</strong></h3>
          <p>Today was one of Zoe's biggest updates. The data management has been completely redesigned to work with a database. Zoe will now be much more stable. I also took the opportunity to review how we retrieve data from LoL. An improvement in the speed of loading for the infocards will normally be felt. Zoe is now limited by the number of accesses Riot gives her and not by herself. I will look with them to improve this. Here is the patch note:&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
          <p>The way Zoe handles data has been completely redesigned to work with a database, which wasn't the case before. Zoe should gain stability. I have also redesigned the way Zoe fetches data from the LoL servers which should drastically increase the speed of loading the information cards. This improvement shouldn't be too noticeable right away as it is now blocked by the limit that Riot gives me. I am working with them to improve this.</p>
          <p>Zoe work now with a database ! -&gt; Stability improved -&gt; Restart and update time reduced to 1 min ! -&gt; Issue will be more simple to debug&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Infocards are now directly deleted when the match is ended.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Infocards loading is now way faster (but we are limited by our actual call limit, i work with riot to increase it) Considering the scope of the modifications, some bugs could have appeared in the new code. If you encounter one, I invite you to report it in the official discord server here : <a href="https://discord.gg/XuZAfGK">https://discord.gg/XuZAfGK</a>&nbsp;</p>

Fortunately nothing serious, it was just fogged up. I also updated Mordekaiser's icon, I had forgotten about him, the poor man. I improved Zoe's servers! This should improve its responsiveness. Ah and, one last thing. I was in a test period until very recently, I will resume normal development in a short time. I will review the functionalities to be developed as a priority.&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>unknown rank - error fixed</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Update Mordekaiser icon.&nbsp;</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Improve Zoe Server perfs (30%~)</strong></p>

          <p>Little "bonus" patch today. A Zoe user asked to add a refresh command to get information about the game faster. I thought it was a good idea and so I added it. You can use it with the command <code>&gt;refresh</code> (or <code>&gt;r</code>). This will not make an instant refresh but will ask the server that is in charge of it to do it as quickly as possible, so it is normal that it is not instantaneous. The speed of the command also varies depending on the current use of Zoe</p>

          <h3>V1.0 → 1.1.0</h3>
          <p>A new version of Zoe is now available ! Here is the patch note of the new version:&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Adding recover and reset commands. (Check information below)&nbsp;</strong></p>
          <p><strong>First implementation of Stats Commands, try </strong><code><strong>&gt;stats help</strong></code><strong>. (Actually seems broken, we check for a solution)&nbsp;</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Save System improvement.&nbsp;</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Fix the bug where infocard is not deleted correctly.&nbsp;</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Some minor fix&nbsp;</strong></p>
          <p>We got an issue with the actual save system, and Zoe actually don't save any data. Fortunately, our backups have allowed us to keep some of the data. But some data has been lost anyway. So I developed a recovery system. It is a command that will read the last 1000 messages of a channel and will re-run all player and team management config commands inside. It will then just have to redefine the channel that was previously used with the <code>&gt;define infochannel #your-channel</code> command. If this solution doesn't work, you need to reconfig manually the bot.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;I apologize for this inconvenience.&nbsp;</p>
