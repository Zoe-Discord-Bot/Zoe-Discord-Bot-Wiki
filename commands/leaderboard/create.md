# /create leaderboard
## Information
**If you use this command, the creation wizard for a [leaderboard](/en/features/leaderboards) will start. You can create [leaderboards](/en/features/leaderboards) that show the top 10 (on premium servers: 100) registered [players](/en/terms/player) in a category of your choice. Categories to choose are:**
- **Total Mastery points**
- **Mastery points on a specific champion**
- **All queue rank (Best)**
- **Specific queue rank (Solo/DuoQ, Flex or TFT)**
- **Average KDA**
- **Average KDA on a specific champion**

**For [leaderboards](/en/features/leaderboards) with specific champions you have to select the champion, search the list and send their number or just their name (e.g.: "28" or "Ezreal").**
