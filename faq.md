## In which languages is Zoe available ?
Zoe is currently fully translated into English and German and partially translated into French, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish, Russian and Arabic as well as Turkish.  Learn more here: [Translations](/en/translation).

Please bear in mind that we cannot offer all languages and are dependent on the community for complete translations. Thanks!

We are happy about anyone who wants to help us with the translation because in that way we can make it so more people can use Zoe.

## Can I define several channels in one text channel?
Yes and no. This works in theory, but not in practice, because all messages in Zoe's [infochannel](/en/features/infochannel) that do not belong there are deleted, including those from the [rankchannel](/en/features/rankchannel) or other channels. If you have the problem that the messages are deleted, you can undefine one of the two channels and define it again in another text channel.
Please try to not mix these channels.

## Which games are / why is flex / TFTÂ displayed in [infopanel](/en/features/infochannel)?

The [infopanel](/en/features/infochannel) shows the last update of the rank by default. If your last game was a flex game, this change is shown. You can change this behavior in Zoes config (see the [configuration](/en/Zoe-Configuration/Infochannel/Infochannel-Rankfilter) or [this guide](/en/Guides/SoloQ-Infopanel)).
<br>

## Why don't I see any slash commands / why don't they work?
This can have 2 possible causes:
- First, you have not given Zoe permission to use the commands on your server. Please go into Zoe's role permissions and enable them.
- If it still does not work, it is most likely because you invited Zoe with the old invitation link that did not have a setting enabled that allows Zoe to use the commands. Since these links should be updated, you can kick Zoe and invite her again using a new link, then the slash-commands should work. 

Don't worry, kicking Zoe from your server does not delete your [configuration](/en/Zoe-Configuration).

## How can I support Zoe and its development?
You can support us monthly with a small amount on Kofi and get some cool features on top. Find out more [here (support article)](/en/support/). Or visit the donation website [here (donation website)](https://zoe-discord-bot.ch/donate.html).
<br>

## How can I stop others from tracking my account with Zoe?
There is a banlist that you can put yourself on. This allows you (an account owner) to delete your account from other servers and make it impossible for others to add. More info for the command: [`/banaccount`](/en/commands/player/banaccount).

To do this, you must verify that you are the owner of the account. To do so you need to have access to it in the game client.
<br>

## Where can I see what will be developed next?
We have set up a special page to inform you about upcoming features. Feel free to have a look there: [Development Status](/en/Development-Status).
<br>

## Do I need to do anything to get Zoe to update the [infopanel](/en/features/infochannel), [gamecards](/en/features/gamecards) or [leaderboards](/en/features/leaderboards) etc?
No, you don't have to do anything, but if you want to force a manual refresh you can use the [`/refresh`](/en/commands/basic/refresh/) command.

## Which features for TFT does Zoe offer?
We've compiled a list of TFT-features for you here:
